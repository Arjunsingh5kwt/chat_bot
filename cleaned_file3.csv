	Flexible Dates  Create a broad date range based on a range of dates you are open to travel Some Members are seasonal workers or if retired only want to travel during certain seasons In these cases you will want to put an extended date range For example teachers generally have the summer off between the end of June and the end of August Such Members will want to put a date range from the end of June to the end of August Then as SENIORHOMEXCHANGECOM captures other Member39s date ranges within your broad date range you can send them InMail Messages to begin a dialog find out which dates are acceptible to them and determine if you can be flexible accepting the other Member39s date range
