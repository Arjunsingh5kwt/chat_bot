Western NY has some of the most wonderful summers on the entire planet,"Western NY has some of the most wonderful summers on the entire planet. While laying on our deck lounges searching for satellites that scurry north and south across the night sky, I start. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Where did you get the idea of exchanging homes in the first place?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I saw it either in the travel section of the paper or somewhere in a travel magazine.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You know, the idea is intriguing.

Exactly how does one go about exchanging houses with other people?,"It has been at least a year now since my wife first hit me up with the question about exchanging houses with strangers. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re driving to Cleveland to visit #1 son, so I think it is safe to bring up the subject. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Exactly how does one go about exchanging houses with other people?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There are websites that specialize in connecting people. According to what Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve read, they all charge something and offer different services.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Knowing the answer before I ask, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Do you have a website in mind that youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d like to use? ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Of course not, silly. I thought you could look into it. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re better at that stuff than I am.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ok,"", she says without hesitation.",
What criteria would I use to join an exchange website?,"I began to ask myself, ""What criteria would I use to join an exchange website?"" While looking at prospective websites, I really wanted something that met our circumstance and situation. ""What were some of the major points I was looking for?"". you may ask. We wanted to exchange with older couples who were likely to be more flexible and open to exchange dates. We figured they would be, more or less, at the same stage of life as we were entering. Another issue for us was costs. We didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mind spending something, but we didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t value services that sounded more like a timeshare where you acquire points or where they provided some form of concierge services. I wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t sure what a concierge service was or how it would work in the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Exchangeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ world. The point was, I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think we needed such services nor would we want it! So, I stumble on an older website that focused on seniors. It was clearly an older website from a web design perspective. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Boyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, I thought, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½this is just what I think we are looking for. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a bit antiquated and clunky, but the right price and focused on the nearly retjourney was underway.",
What happened to the other Senior Home Exchange website?,"Right about now, anyone following Stories is asking himself or herself the question, ""If THIS is SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM, what happened to the other Senior Home Exchange website?"" Good question. Letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s back up a few years. By then, we had used the site to exchange with a number of other members and were ready to plan our next exchange. We went to the website in 2016 and it was dark, dead, not there! There was no explanation or anything. A bit of Internet searching and I find several discussion groups lamenting the fact Senior Home Exchange had gone dark and they were not happy about it. After much research and due diligence, I discover the website was owned by someone in Canada, near Toronto. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Shame thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, I thought to no one in particular. Then I share the bad news with my wife. Rarely deterred, she said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Well I still want to exchange our home. Letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s look into the alternatives.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Of course, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½let'sï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ portion of her comment was code for, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿",
"After searching, sure enough, there are sites out there.","Sure enough, there are exchange sites out there. The problem was, there were not any that really fit what we are looking for. None fit what we liked about the old Senior Home Exchange. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What were we looking for?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ you might be asking. Well, we wanted it to be focused on the active, older community that had flexibility to travel, sought adventure in exploring places they had not explored before, had reasons to travel to a locality for whatever personal reason and that they wanted to be part of a community of likeminded people. Community and likeminded-ness are important to us. Community, to us, meant people who value meeting & interacting with new people, have things in common and want to be part of something cool, different, interesting. Likeminded-ness, to us, meant people who see every opportunity they face as an adventure, practice the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Golden Ruleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by taking care of someone else's property the way they take care of their own and embrace ho, we wanted Senior Home Exchange but with a technology upgrade. By that, I mean, we wanted better search functionality, the ability to upload pictures using modern cloud-based and smartphone technology, etc. That was the only missing element to the old site. AND, it was very affordable!",
My wife was determined to get us back on the exchange track.,"By 2017, my wife was determined to get us back on the exchange track. One day she says, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Well, if we canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t find what we are looking for, why donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t we start a new website the way we want?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Oh, BOY! If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been following Stories for very long, you know THAT is a generous ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½WE!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Translation ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Why donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t YOU start a website for us that does everything we want and upgrade the technology so it works for our community of Members?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You know, that is a very intriguing proposition. Why donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t we!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Thus, our journey became the inspiration to design and build SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM. We would do it in ways that other sites are not and do it the way we wanted it to be. And, of course, I was doing it for my wife. Specifically, we wanted to create a community of likeminded people in ways that gave te long haul, making it sustainable and affordable for Members. So, in 2018, we began development of SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM. We look forward to providing you, our committed and trusted Member many years of fulfilled exchanges between a community of likeminded people who seek adventure through travel, enjoy meeting new people (possibly developing lasting friendships) and like the appeal of stretching their travel budget in ways not possible through traditional travel means. Our commitment to you, our faithful community of likeminded adventure seekers is to keep this site relevant and affordable. AND, our commitment is to keep SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM going long after we are gone through the legacy of our son, a natural born entrepreneur with the same passion for community and affordable travel.",
The very first thing you need to do after you have decided that exchanging is for you is to decide what value you offer other prospective exchange partners.,"The very first thing you need to do after you have decided that exchanging is for you is to decide what value you offer other prospective exchange partners. It all starts there. By value, I mean, what does your locality bring to prospective exchange partners that would entice them to say, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You know, THAT is an interesting place to go. Letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s consider exchanging with these people.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ You see, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all about locality, not the dwelling. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve exchanged with people whose home was a two-bedroom bungalow compared to our three-bedroom house. We loved it! Was the bungalow as nice as our house? No. Did we care? No. The bungalow served our needs as a comfortable base to explore the area we were visiting. It had everything we needed and it felt every bit like home as our own home. On another occasion, we exchanged with a couple whose home was far nicer than ours. It was all on one floor, sprawling and architecturally speaking, more appeali from which they were able to explore our locality. So, it is not about the home, the real estate, the property, though that can be a plus. It is about having a home base from which to explore the surrounding area. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s it. Pure",
Step #1 is deciding that exchanging is for you.,"Step #1 is deciding that exchanging is for you. Step #2 is deciding what you have to offer (or better, what your locality has to offer) to entice people to want to come to your area. What kind of things does your area have that other areas don't? What is your proximity to other areas (urban, wilderness, cultures, etc.) that make it worth visiting? For example, we live in Western NY, which is to say near Buffalo. The name alone brings visions of massive winter snow storms that most of the rest of the country (and probably the world) see on newscasts. Who wants to visit Buffalo? Well, many people do not know we have an embarrassment of riches in terms of quality restaurants and cuisines. In upstate NY, there is the Culinary Institute of NY. Many young Buffalonians go there and come home to open some of the most interesting and exceptional restaurants that you would have trouble finding outside of NY City or San Francisco. We have Niagara Falls, one of the Wonders of the World. We have Toronto an hour and a half drive to the north. We are an hour flight to NY City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. You can drive to either of those cities in seven hours or less. Western NY is nestled between two world-class wine districts; The Canadian Niagara Peninsula (world renown for their Riesling & Ice wines) that rival their older German Alsatian wine district, & The New Yorkï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Finger Lakes region (producing wonderful varietals of Riesling, Sayval, etc.). I could go on, but you get the point. It's about what your locality can off",
"Do we want to exchange short term, long term or somewhere in between?","Back when we began to consider exchanging our home, we considered the possibilities. Do we want to exchange short term, long term or somewhere in between? Of course, we kept coming back to the same conclusion. Yes! Yes, to short term. Yes, to long term. And, yes, to somewhere in between. Short term for us meant a long weekend up to a week somewhere. Of course, the practicality of travel comes into play for short term exchanges. For example, where we live in Western New York, many people like to come down from Toronto to shop in the Fall, especially when the exchange rate is favorable. Even when the exchange rate isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t favorable, they still make the trek across the border to shop. For people who live in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area), a shopping trip to the US can be a very, very, very long day. Traffic getting to one of the three US border crossings and the lines just to get through customs can take a lot of time. Torontonians can get lodging, stay the night or two and head home after the wee of more than one day increases the amount of goods they can bring back to Canada duty free, which makes the trip more worthwhile. Essentially, they turn the trip into a long weekend adventure. Many Western New Yorkers love Toronto. We would be happy to experience Toronto without having to pay for the expense of a hotel. In addition, Toronto has great public transportation, but it is not friendly to automobiles. Having a home base where you can park your car is an important luxury. Downtown hotel parking is like parking in New York City or any other world class city. Space is a premium and using the space to park a car is very expensive. Thus, likeminded Buffalonians and Torontonians are ideal ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½long weekendï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ exc",
Most people want to get away for a week or two.,"Up to now, we have talked about deciding to arrange a long weekend exchange. Most people, though want to get away for a week or two. Arranged well enough in advance, people can book low cost flights; redeeming credit card miles or simply paying for economy fares. People have exchanged with other couples to take advantage of low-cost cruise line dates. They may stay in the locality (like Fort Lauderdale, Houston, Cape Canaveral/Daytona area) for two weeks during an exchange, but four days of that stay may have been a short cruise to the Bahamas or Caribbean. When considering an exchange, you always want to determine what your needs are, what you want to get from the exchange? Are you simply wanting to just to get away? Or, do you have a specific event in mind? You could be wanting to visit your grandkids for an extended period of time. Maybe there is a graduation to attend. It could mean exploring a part of the country you havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t explored before or havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t been to in many yea have a wedding to attend and you would like to stay around for a while to discover that part of the country either before the wedding, after or both. Again, the length of exchange and the reason to exchange in a certain locality can vary, but the mindset remains the same; find a willing, flexible, adventurous exchange partner and make it happen. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be surprised how easy, enjoyable and fulfilling exchanging your home is. It will bring the concept of travel to a whol",
One of the things to consider is where to exchange.,"One of the things to consider is where to exchange. Some people are looking for very specific places. The more adventurous are not so concerned with the specific locality as they are to just experiencing someplace different, new or someplace they havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t been to in a long time. In fact, you would be surprised to know many people are not looking for exotic locations as much as they are looking to get away and take in new experiences in new places. One example comes to mind. We exchanged with a lovely couple a few years back who lived in Kansas City. Actually, they had just moved back there from Arizona. They had a property in a place called Green Valley, which is south of Tucson. They called us and asked if we had booked our summer trip yet. We said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ They said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s exchange, but we would prefer you exchange with our place in Green Valley rather than Kansas City. We loved the idea, so we set our plans in motion to exchinto the one-month exchange, they called us and asked how we like the area and the home we were staying at. We said we were having a ball! The next question surprised us, though it shouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have. They asked, would you like to buy the place! We never saw it coming. In this case, we were not interested and with what we hoped was tact and grace declined their offer to place a bid. That can happen when you own multiple properties and you want to have people experience the area in a rather clever marketing ploy. We were not offended and I do not think they were either. SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM allows Members to list up to two active properties for exactly that reason. Our experience with our exchange partners led to us add a feature to SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM that allows Members to showcase their ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½otherï¿½ï¿",
What kind of Member is SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM designed for?,"When we talk to people about the exchange concept, they ask us,""What kind of Member is SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM designed for?"" SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM appeals to people who are looking for value, are able to find exchange partners that have the same outlook on life and prefer to chart their own course in terms of determining where and when they want to exchange. We prefer not to insert ourselves between one Member deciding to exchange with another Member. I guess you could say we are not micro managers! As a forum, SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is designed to make it easy for Members to exchange as often as they want with as many likeminded people as they want without being ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bothered, hounded or pushedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ to exchange. We are a community intent on helping Members locate potential exchange partners through Member initiated searches. You can take the time to look at as any and all Members one-by-one or you can do searches by locality. There are many different ways to search, like searching by zip code range, by state/province or by country. When one Member looks up another Member's information, important personal ged. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What kind of personal information is omitted?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, you ask. The Member's last name and email address are not available to other Members when they search for an Exchange partner. All initial communications are done via the SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM website through our InMail feature. If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve communicated using Craigï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s List or LinkedIn, it operates very similar to those websites. When a property is shown on the map, it does not show the actual address. It shows a close approximation of where the home is located (correct city, state/province, country) but not the exact address location. We respect your privacy and the privacy of all Members. We do not divulge such information to other Members. When you get to the point of wanting to exchange with another Member, you can then exchange your personal information and communicate directly via phone, email, Skype, Facetime, Facebook or whatever mediu",
Deciding length of stay during an exchange is dependent upon your need.,"Deciding length of stay during an exchange is dependent upon your need, desire and circumstance. As mentioned in an earlier Story, long weekends can be useful for attending weddings, visiting a city for a show or to shop. Experiencing a major metropolitan area that is easy to get to via car or plane is more suited for short term exchanges like long weekends or less than a week. For Members who want to go someplace for five to ten days (what we call a week exchange potentially including bookend weekends) are more likely to be doing so to visit relatives or friends. Sometimes they are traveling for a special event. If you are seeking a multi-week exchange, you are probably wanting to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½get awayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and experience a new locality or to visit a place you havenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t been to in a long time. Those who are looking to exchange for an extended period of time (three weeks, a month or more) are looking to experience a region and are happy to have a base from which to explore. Thof Members who are traveling from one country to another or from one region on one side of the country to another region on the other side. It doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t matter what your preference is so long as it works for you. And, your preference can be all the above. Within SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM, it is important to visit your ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½My Accountï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and go to Exchange Preferences where you can let other Members know your preference for exchange lengths of stay as well as other preferences. You can check the boxes that apply to your desires and circumstance. You can check as many as you like so other Members know you are open to different lengths of exchanges. Your choices range from long weekends, a week, several weeks & a month or more. Exchange preferences is one of the attributes Members can search to identify likeminded Members who have the same length of stay preferences. They more you populate preference attributes, the better you are communicating to other Membe",
What does your locality have to offer?,"What does your locality have to offer? We had one couple exchange with us from Arizona. Their kids (now grown with their own family) lived in NJ and they wanted to be near enough to them for them to visit for a week. They asked us and we had no problem with it. We said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sure.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We exchange for a month with them one summer. For us, Western NY has some of the most beautiful summers any locality could want. They wanted to get out of Arizona during the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hotï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ monsoon season (as do most Arizonans!). We like to hike, play golf and my wife hadnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t experienced the Desert Southwest Monsoon season before, so it was an exchange made in Heaven. The funny part was, our exchange partners planned to take a week driving to Montreal & Quebec City. Montreal is about a four-hour drive and Quebec is another two hours from Montreal. The last week before we were to return to our respective homes, we were talking on the phone with them (you always wa if you are exchanging for an extended period of time (more on that in a later Story). So we asked, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½How was Montreal & Quebec City?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ They said they decided not to go. We asked, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ They floored us! They said they were having so much fun in Buffalo that they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t see a need to go to Toronto, much less Montreal or Quebec City. Go figure. That is the beauty of exchanging, partic",
Short-term exchanges are not the only exchanges to consider.,"Exchanges between Torontonians and Western New Yorkers are not the only short-term exchanges to consider. People have arranged exchanges between LA and the San Francisco Bay area. In other situations, couples have arranged exchanges between coasts from Washington, DC or NY City with the west coast. People who want to exchange homes between the Washington, DC to Boston corridor can make a trip of it using Amtrak. With Lift or Uber, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), DCï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Metro or NY Cityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s subway system, a long weekend can turn into a great adventure without having to get behind the wheel! People have exchanged between Chicago & St. Louis, St. Louis & Kansas City, Houston & Dallas, Houston and New Orleans. The list of possibilities for long weekend jaunts are only limited by the imagination. North of Toronto is what Torontonians infamously call, Cottage Country. Of course, there are opportunities for Canadians to exchange between Vancouver or the Maritime pva Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland). Again, the only limitation is the imagination and finding the right (likeminded) partner or couple. No need to limit your imagination to North America. If you are a Brazilian with friends and family in Miami (where there is a large and vibrant Brazilero community) you can see a couple from Rio or Sao Paulo jumping a plane north for an extended stay while the exchange partner heads south. Then there is the UK, where folks in the north country or midlands might want to visit London while those Londoners escape to the northern parts like Scotland, the Lake District or go the other way to the south English coast. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all possible through SENIORHOME",
Longer exchanges allow you to have a lot of time in front of you to explore and do things you like to do.,"My wife and I have exchanged for a month at a time on several occasions. What is nice about longer exchanges is you get to your destination and you have so much time in front of you to explore and do things you like to do. The immediate feeling of a long exchange is one of comfort and relaxation. You donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t feel as though you have to cram events into your schedule. You quickly realize you have time to plan what you want to do, when you want to do it and where. With longer exchanges, you want to consider what an area has to offer that you would like to do. You open up so many more possibilities if you are open to going places that are available as opposed to just focusing on going to a specific place. This is where Time-to-Go can be a big help. You can set date ranges for the time you would like to travel. SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM then compares your date range with other Membersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ date ranges and returns the ones that most closely match yours. If your date range is a long-term staye more likely to match with other Members who are also looking for a long-term exchange around the same timeframe. You can click on their profile, look at what they say about their locality and begin to imagine the possibilities available to you if you did arrange an exchange with them. Contacting them is easy. To get the dialog going, simply send them an InMail saying, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hey, were interested in exchanging with you.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll review your profile and see what you have to say about your locality. In most cases, theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll send you back a reply one way or the other. And,",
What to do when a Member responds to your InMail message?,"Letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s say a potential exchange partner replies favorably to your InMail. What to do next? Well, you send them back an InMail asking them about themselves that is not already shared on their profile. And, in that InMail, you want to be sure to share with them things about you that arenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t on your profile. Getting to know your potential exchange partner is of utmost importance. At the end of the day, you are trying to decide whether you like them, trust them and would want to exchange with them. Throughout the vetting process, you are essentially looking for red flags. Not everyone is amenable or compatible. You are looking for people who you can identify with, build a trusting relationship with and feel comfortable sharing your home with. The good news about home exchanging is both you and your exchange partner have skin in the game because they will be in your home while you are in theirs! At this early stage, you want to share with them general things about yourself. Are you , with a partner as a couple, etc. You get the idea. Keep it brief, interesting and light in the early stages of sharing with potential exchange partner. The questions you ask them should be equally appropriate; brief, interesting and light!",
What goes into vetting a potential exchange partner?,"What goes into vetting a potential exchange partner? There are several basic steps that I've listed below. I will expand on them in later Stories. The quick answer is to get to know your potential exchange partner. And, to do that you need to have multiple interactions (conversations, emails, Skype or Facetime sessions, etc.). As mentioned in earlier posts, SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM has InMail that allows you to anonymously communicate with potential exchange partners. It is best to have at least three to five InMail conversations before you decide to Skype, share emails or phone numbers. You want to know as much about them as is reasonable. And, you want to share with your potential exchange partner as much about you as is reasonable. Think quid pro quo. You share and expect to get similar disclosure in return. If you donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t feel you are getting like-in-kind disclosure from them as you are sharing with them, consider that a red flag. Here are a few topics we will delve into deeper in future Storiis their situation? What about them, in general? 2) What is their motivation for an exchange? 3) How long do they want to exchange? How flexible are they? 4) What are they hoping to experience from the exchange? 5) Are there any limitations related to an exchange (physical, time constraints, special considerations, etc.) 6) What are their interests? 7) What type of personal preferences do they have? The more you learn about them and the more you share about yourself, the more you both become comfortable with each other. And, at the point you both feel comfortable with each other and you feel you are willing to exchange with them is the time to consider taking your conversation off-line by communicating directly via Skype, FaceTime, Facebook, email, phone or what have you.",
You want to learn about your potential exchange partner.,"What is the situation of your potential exchange partner? By situation, I mean, what is their general situation in life? Are you talking with an individual or a couple? If a couple, how long have they been together? If knowing they are married or not is important to you, ask that too. Always be mindful, this is not an inquisition. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re genuinely interested in learning about them, getting to know they. It is always a better conversation if you tell them about yourself before you ask them. It comes across better if you offer up first, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been together for five years, but weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not married. How about you?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, assuming that your situation is youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re a couple, significant others, but not married. Some other things you might want to share with them and learn from them includes the following. Have they lived in the area (they currently reside) for long? How long? What brought them to that locality? How long have e they renting? Do they have children? If so, how old? Where do they live? Do they have children? Are they retired? If so, how long? What is/was their profession? Did they go to college & if so, where? Most people are proud of their alma maters, so asking this kind of question should illicit responses about their sports teams, their academics or what have you. In the end, you want to understand who they are and what motivates them. What makes them tick, what their outlook on life is.",
Why does your potential exchange partner want to exchange?,"Why does your potential exchange partner want to exchange? Is this their first exchange or have they exchanged before? If before, how many times? What kind timeframes have they exchanged? What did they like about their exchanges? Did they particularly like one exchange over others? Why? Was it because of locality, duration, specific (fond) memories, what? What has been their experience with exchanges? What are they concerned about? What situations or circumstances are they looking for or that they want to avoid? Try to understand what they are looking for and why they feel the way they do. Are they looking to exchange for a particular reason like getting close to family members or old friends? Are they wanting to exchange because there is a specific event around which they are basing this exchange like a wedding, a graduation, an anniversary, etc.? And, of course, you want to reciprocate. Be sure to share with them what you expect them to share with you. Again, the aim is not to interrogate your potential exchange partner. You just want to get to know them and make sure (if you do agree to exchange) it is a good fit for you and them.",
How long does your potential exchange partner want to exchange?,"How long does your potential exchange partner want to exchange? What are their current parameters for their next exchange? Are they flexible or are there time constraints? Do they have to be in your locality on a certain date? Do they have to be back at their home by a certain date? Are they fixed on a certain set of dates to exchange or are they flexible within reason? Are they open to a certain duration or can they exchange over a shorter time period or a longer period? Keep in mind, while you both may have connected with the interest of exchanging this year or next, donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t rule out potentially arranging an exchange further into the future. Perhaps you both have constraints with the dates you want to exchange this year or next. But you hit it off! Be sure to explore the possibility to getting a date on the calendar two or three years from now. You can always change your minds, but, in the meantime, you can continue to dialog and build a relationship that can lead to an exchange sometime in this one point is perhaps the most important about arranging exchanges with other exchange partners. Future planning allows you to anticipate and prepare for trips. It becomes something you look forward to and fills up your travel schedule!",
What are you and your exchange partner wanting to get from the exchange?,"What are you and your exchange partner wanting to get from the exchange? This is important to know. Not only for yourself but for your potential exchange partner. While you cannot know everything, nor should you, you want to understand what they want to get from exchanging with you. And you want to make sure they understand what you hope to get from the exchange. What are they wanting to do or achieve in exchanging with you? Are they looking to hang out and relax? Are they looking to use your home as a base and travel to other places near where you live that would be impractical from where they live? Are they wanting to get close to family members or friends and spend time with them? For example, are they wanting their grown children and their families to come visit for a period of time? If so, are you ok with that? Do you have concerns? Do they expect to be away from the house for a period of time (like traveling to another city in proximity to where you live)? If so, are you ok with your home being unoccupied while they are traveling?

Are there limitations you need to be aware of if you exchange?,"Are there limitations you need to be aware of if you exchange? For example, are there physical limitations that you have or your exchange partner has? Does someone need ADA compliant areas? Are stairs a problem? Is it difficult for someone to navigate a multiple floor home? Is an elevator a requirement or a ramp for wheelchair access a requirement? Does someone have a need to be near a dialysis care facility? Has one of you recently gone through a medical procedure that creates special requirements. Are there other limitations or constraints a person needs to be concerned about, like ready access to an airport because they have to take a trip during the exchange? Whatever the situation may be, you will want to understand any and all issues that your prospective exchange partner may have. And, as always, you will want to be transparent about any limitations you may have that they should be aware of.",
What are your potential exchange partnerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,"What are your potential exchange partnerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s interests? The more you know about your exchange partners interests, the better you will be able to share with them what your locality has to offer that will interest them. Equally important, you will want to let your potential exchange partners know what your interests are so they can share with you the things that their locality offers in that regard. Are they golfers, tennis players, bocce players, bicyclers or joggers? What is available in your area, their area. Do they like to go on long walks? Are they birders or hikers? Do they like to visit national or state parks? Are they campers, water enthusiasts or do they like to fish? Do they like to go to a pool to swim laps or to just wade in? Are they architectural enthusiasts or gardeners? Are there botanical gardens or special architecturally significant structures in your locality that they might enjoy visiting? Are they avid wine enthusiasts who like to visit wine regions or wineries? Are they iweries? What kind of cuisine do they enjoy? What is available in your area? Do they like to play board games? If so, what kind of games do you have in your home? What unique things are found in your locality that are not available in other localities? The more attractive you can make your locality, the more your locality can satisfy your potential exchange partners interest, the more attractive your home will be as an exchange destination.",
What personal preferences do you and your potential exchange partners have?,"What personal preferences do you and your potential exchange partners have? Are you pet owners? Are they? If so, what kinds of pets? Would you or your exchange partners want you to take care of their pets? Would you want to bring your pet on the exchange with you? Would your exchange partner? Are you ok with that? On the other hand, are you allergic to certain animals? Do you prefer to not be in a home that has pets? Are you smokers or non-smokers? Is someone an accomplished chef or baker that needs certain equipment to cook or bake? What type of entertainment do you like? Is that expected to be available via a home theater system or available as a night out? Everyone, it seems, needs internet to function. Is it adequate? What type (cable, fiber, etc.) and what are the download & upload speeds? Is WiFi available in your home? You will need to make sure they have the access codes and passwords to use it. Some people are not TV watchers. Some canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t live without it. Does your home accommodate thent needs of your exchange partners? Are there certain shows or channels they MUST have access to while they are in your home? Do you have the capability to play Blu-Ray & DVD movies? Is there a smart speaker or stereo system that someone can connect their iPod or a list of local radio stations that they like to listen to for music, news or sports?

"Ultimately, vetting is about uncovering ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Red ","Ultimately, vetting is about uncovering ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Red Flagsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Red flags do not imply people are not good people. It only suggests concerns about the likelihood of a good fit between exchange partners. You are looking for open communication that clicks with you and resonates with them, too. You are looking for commonality of the important things. For example, if you are non-smokers and they are not and they smoke in their home (as is their prerogative), you may not be comfortable staying at their home. That is particularly true if you have a medical condition that residual smoke exacerbates. If you are allergic to cats and your exchange partner has three of them, that is certainly a red flag! Chances are the exchange wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t work for you. Are they forthcoming about their information; their home, their circumstances and their level of mutual disclosure? If not, there may be an issue between you and your exchange partner for whatever reason. In such cases, you may want to ut a round peg in a square hole. If your potential exchange partnerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s home requires access to three floors (like washer & dryer in the basement, kitchen on the first floor and bedrooms on the second floor) and you have trouble walking up and down stairs on a regular basis, that home may not be a good fit for you. Is your intent in exchanging to have your family or friends visit while you are at your exchange partnerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s home? If they are not comfortable with that arrangement, you have a potential conflict. In the end, red flags can be big things or they can be minor things. The less of them you have between you and your exchange partners, the more likely the success for the both of you. In such circumstances, you both will more likely enjoy exchanging your homes and experiencing you",
Agreeing to exchange has many facets.,"Once you and your potential exchange partner are comfortable with each other, the next step is to agree to exchange. Agreeing to exchange is not a trivial issue, though. What goes into agreeing to exchange? It varies. Agreeing to exchange has many facets. There are major points (which you have already been discussing during the vetting process) like when to exchange & how long. Are you planning to exchange cars whereby you drive their car while you are at their home and vice versa? In addition, there is the tricky question of money. As part of the Terms of Use of SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM, you have already agreed to NOT exchange money for any reason between you and your exchange partner. If for some reason your exchange partner brings it up, we recommend you explain to them it is the policy of SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM that all Members agreed to not receive any monetary compensation as a result of an exchange. That includes someone wanting to pay for utilities and have you pay for their utilities. Keep it simple. Say, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Noï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, nicely! Your exchange partner may not be aware or have forgotten that they agreed to not exchange funds as a condition of the Terms of Use of their Membership. If they are aware of it and still pursue the topic, that certainly would qualify as a Red Flag. Keep in mind, the vetting process is ongoing and each time you engage to arrange an exchange, you should be taking any and all new information into account as it regards looking for Red Flags and, otherwise, ensuring you have a good exchange experience. Agreeing to exchange your home is like any other arrangement between two parties. Be clear, unambiguous, straightforward. If you feel you need to, you can memorialize the important points of an exchange in some written communication. For the exchanges we have made, multiple email exchanges have sufficed as written communications outlining our mutual understanding of the exchange. More on that ",
Members agree to NOT charge other Members any monetary amount.,"SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM Terms of Us policy purposely has a clause in it that Members agree to NOT charge other Members any monetary amount in the way of compensation for or during an exchange except in the case where the Member damages the other Memberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s property during the exchange. This is important and it is in place to protect both Members. Being compensated for an exchange is counter to the whole concept of exchanging. It runs against the concept of community. In addition, the minute you start charging any amount for the use of your home, you create complications. Reporting income, impact on your homeownerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s policy and other issues come to mind. Plus, our whole purpose for creating SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is to facilitate affordable home exchanges between a community of likeminded people. This is at the core of what ",
Many people have asked us if the issue of money has come up before when we exchanged our home?,"Many people have asked us if the issue of money has come up before when we exchanged our home? Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve asked, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What are some of the best ways to handle the topic?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ To the first question the answer is, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yes, my wife and I have been asked to cover certain expenses.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ In arranging one exchange, our potential exchange partner proposed we pay their utilities while we were exchanging and they would pay our utilities while they were at our home. We simply said no. Though we were arranging a four-week exchange, we were not interested in trying to compute utilities. We said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re not interested in doing that. If it is a requirement of yours (our potential exchange partner) then weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d prefer to not go forward with the exchange. We thanked them for asking, but we didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to go down that road.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ They said theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d think about it and getould not be charging each other for utilities or any other home operating expense. In the end, we exchanged with them and they were wonderful people. Notice, however, we were perfectly willing to walk away from the potential exchange if that were a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½must haveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ requirement of theirs. We were very glad we dealt with the issue upfront so as to not have it become an issue later. Always be prepared to walk away and say, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½noï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ if you feel uncomfortable, whatever the reason. There are p",
What else is there to agree to besides when and how long?,"What else is there to agree to besides when and how long? There is more, much more! Take for example, exchanging your automobile so neither exchange partner needs to rent a car. Now, there are obvious savings doing that for both parties. However, you both have to be comfortable with doing so. That requires agreeing! We have done that on some of the exchanges we have had and it has worked out just great. Other exchanges, our exchange partners were not comfortable with exchanging cars and we didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t. How about situations where one party lives in a golf community and owns a golf cart. Are you willing to allow your exchange partners to use your golf cart? We had exactly that situation. And, they were gracious enough to allow us to use it. It was great because getting around the community (to pools, the golf course, etc.) was so much easier with the golf cart. The community was designed around the use of golf carts and it made our exchange infinitely more enjoyable. It was much to their credit for the use of it. Needless to say, we had a great exchange experience and they were as wonderful as they were gracious. Are you bicyclers? If so, are you OK with your exchange partners using your bikes while they are in your home. Some people (like us) are happy to have people use our bikes. We are near a rails-to-trails pathway that goes a lot of places, so we encourage our exchange partners to use our bikes. Someone else may have a Tour de France quality bike and not want their weekend peloton biking partners use it much less an exchange partner. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s different for each person. Bring it up, talk about it, and then agree (or not)! Do you have a high-quality barbecue grill or smoker that you wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t trust your eldest son with much less an exchange partner? If so, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve got to tell them you are not comfortable having them use it. If you have such items that are off limits, communicate it at the appropriate time.

Take for example people who have pets. Assuming for a minute they are exchanging with people who either like animals or have their own pets. The big questions are; Do they want to bring their pets with them during the exchange? Do they want to have the pets remain in their home rather than kenneling them? If so, are you expected to take care of them or is there some other arrangement? How is that going to work? What happens if there is a need to have the pet go to the vet (whether an emergency or not)? Which vet? Does the vet know the animal? Who pays for what? After all, an emergency trip to the vet is akin to having to pay for or replace something that gets damaged (like a window, for example). Of course, a pet is not a window, but you get my point. These are not trivial questions and one exchange partner may be amenable to one arrangement where another would desire another, different arrangement.requires care and maintenance. Who is doing that? Is it the exchange partner or is it someone else who has been employed to maintain the pool by the pool owners? If someone else, how comfortable is your exchange partner with having a stranger coming to the home while they are there? Would they be willing to maintain it? We own a pool and the cost to maintain the pool is on us, not our exchange partners. Such issues need to be considered, discussed, understood and agreed upon.",

"Clearing your Home is about removing clutter, but it is much more than that.","Clearing your Home is about removing clutter, but it is much more than that. Of course, removing clutter is part of the process. We all like a bright open environment. We prefer not to have obstacles where we walk or have to clear things out of the way just to use a space. Your Exchange Partner wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know where you would want items put if they move them. They wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know how important your items are to you if they place them elsewhere. So, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s best if you, as the Home owner, put things away ahead of time. Particularly if such items are personally valuable or susceptible to being broken. Clearing also means ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Clearing the wayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Do you have a lawn that needs cutting (if the exchange is for an extended period)? Do you have plants (in the house or outside) that need watering? Do you have a pool that needs occasional attention (cleaning, adding chemicals or what have you)? If you are in a winter environment, is snow plowing or snowýýý issues that you need to consider and have solutions for in Preparing your Home for an exchange. Of course, some of these issues can be managed and agreed to with your Exchange Partner. For example, are they willing to water plants? Maybe. Are they willing to mow the lawn, clean & care for your pool or shovel snow? Maybe not. In the end, you have to make appropriate arrangements so your Exchange Partners are not encumbered with the usual chores associated with maintaining your home while you are away.",
Clearing your home also means making room for your Exchange Partner.,"Clearing your home also means making room for your Exchange Partner. Making space available for them to live during their stay is essential. That includes: Providing at least one clean, unused closet for them to put their clothes, & At least one chest of drawers for them to store other clothing. These are the minimum courtesies you should afford them. They need space to keep their belongings during their stay at your Home just as you will need space at their Home. In addition, it is common to provide a different set of linens for them. That includes sheets, towels and washcloths. It is best and easiest to think what kind of amenities you will need when you are at your Exchange Partnerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Home. They will have the same requirement while staying at your Home. These are the things you need to provide them and they provide you. For example, one of our Exchange Partners was a diabetic and he wanted to ship a supply of insulin to our home prior to him and his wife arriving. We had no problem with it.important that they let us know they had a special request and that they knew we were willing to accommodate it. Also, it was important to let us know so we could anticipate the shipment. If there is any doubt or concern such amenities will be provided, you should create a list and discuss it with them while Agreeing to the exchange.",
Documentation is an underappreciated need when exchanging your home.,"Documentation is an underappreciated need when it comes to exchanging your home. The good news? Once you've done the work, it only needs to be updated when something has changed. You should Prepare a Binder. You want to document how things operate. For example, we all know how to operate our entertainment centers with our four remotes for the TV, Stereo, Cable Box & DVD, but as any guest will attest, the rest of us have no clue which to turn on first, which remote controls what, etc. It is very helpful if you include pictures of remotes and instructions (if necessary) on which remote operates which device. If you are like us, we have three remotes to operate the HD-TV, the Channel box and the Blueray DVR! How you use them together to play a movie, watch your favorite TV show or sporting event is the trick. Make it easy for your Exchange Partner; document how they are used. You will want to make sure you include important passcodes for WiFi Internet service or the garage keypad, too. We call our book the Home Exchange Binder. You also want to document how to turn the alarm system on or off, how to change the settings on your HVAC system, how to run your appliances (if they are not obvious), where your water shutoff & circuit breaker box are located. If there is an emergency, circuit outage or leak problem, this information is invaluable. You want to think through all the contingencies your Exchange Partner could face while they are in your home. They will need to know such information in the event of an unexpected circumstance. And, when something changes, you want to update your Home Exchange Binder to keep it current. A good example is when you change your cable or Internet service provider. In many cases, the box is different, the remote is different or the WiFi passcode is different. Providing your Exchange Partners with key home operating information is invaluable; for them and for you!",
ýýýýýýLabelingýýýýýý your Home is important when Preparing your home for an exchange.,"ýýýýýýLabelingýýýýýý your Home is important when Preparing your home for an exchange. For example, you want to highlight where your water shutoff valve is located in your Home Exchange Binder and label it so your Home Exchange Partner can easily find it. If you have more than one water shutoff valve in your home, you should label them all. In addition, you need to explain in your Home Exchange Binder which valve turns off which part of the house. If there is an emergency, your Exchange Partner can immediately take action with minimal damage or harm. This didnýýýýýýt happen during an exchange, but years ago we had a situation happen where I wished I had labeled our water shutoff. We had a leak in one of our upstairs bathrooms. My wife had no idea, initially. Then the water started to show itself in the ceiling downstairs. She had no idea what to do. Luckily, she went to a neighbor. She called me and I told him where the water shutoff was located. He went in the basement and turned the water off to the second floor. As I said, this didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t happen during an exchange. It happened when I was travelling on business. However, you can see how helpful it would have been and how much less water would have leaked had there not been a delay between identifying the problem and getting ahold of me (to explain where the water shutoff was located). These are the contingencies you need to anticipate. For us, we have multiple water shutoff valves in our basement. Each one has a sign that reads, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Water Shutoffï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. And, each one is listed in our Home Exchange Binder that says what area of the house it affects. We even have a water shutoff to our refrigerator icemaker! I guess that technically counts as three shutoffs! It is important to clearly label where your circuit breaker box is located and which breakers control what parts of the house. It is also helpful to clearly show where flashlights are located in the event things go dark. There are many things we take for granted in our owhing is located. Not so for your Exchange Partner. Preparing for the unexpected or occasional happenstance makes for a more seamless and enjoyable home exchange; for you and your Exchange Partner.",
ýýýýýýSecuringýýýýýý your Home is a broad topic in ways you would not expect.,"ýýýýýýSecuringýýýýýý your Home is a broad topic in ways you would not expect. Of course, it means securing your valuables, your home and your private information. But it also means making your Exchange Partners secure. Let me explain. Those of you who have followed our Stories from the beginning (you can click on the dropdown box and select ýýýýýýStoryýýýýýý at the bottom of the dropdown menu to read these ýýýýýýStoriesýýýýýý in chronological order), securing our personal information (documents, etc.) was one of my original concerns about Exchanging our home. As someone who saved every credit card statement Iýýýýýýd ever received (even those I no longer use!) I had to go through the information and literally shred much of what was long past relevant. Many people ask me, ýýýýýýisnýýýýýýt home exchanging risky?ýýýýýý I reply with an emphatic, ýýýýýýNo!ýýýýýý ýýýýýýWhy?ýýýýýý, they ask. ýýýýýýThere are several reasonsýýýýýý. First, the beauty of Home Exchanging is that you and your Exchange Partners have skin in the game. By that, I mean, we are each staying in the other persons home and that invariably gives each of us a reason to do right by the other. Secondly (and brought to light during this Coronavirus Pandemic), our demographic is becoming more and more concerned and conscious of staying in locations where hundreds of people have stayed before them. You minimize such exposure when you stay in someone else home (where there are far fewer people who have accessed and exposed the home). C-19 has created a new reality, particularly for us who are at greater risk. Public exposure will carry much more weight for all of us in the future. Thirdly, we have neighbors. Whether unspoken or not, neighbors look out for each other. More importantly, whether talking about the places weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve visited or talking about our neighbors, neighbors are fascinated with the people who exchange their home with us. They want to meet the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½New Peopleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and get to know them! In fact, getting tring an exchange) is one of the most rewarding aspects of Home Exchanging. New friendships have been spawned from Home Exchanges.",
What else is involved in Securing oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï,"What else is involved in Securing oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s home? As I said before, you want to secure any personal documents or valuables. Generally, that means having a room or a place in the house that is locked and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½off limitsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. I have not had an experience where people have not respected this. If you are deeply concerned about an item or certain information, securing it off-site with a friend or family member is another option, but Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve not had anything that qualifies as so valuable as to take such a drastic measure. In the end, you have to be comfortable with adequately securing your most precious items. Securing also means making your Exchange Partners feel secure. That means providing letters for the Exchange Partners stating that you have given them permission to stay in your home from the start date of the exchange to the end date. This helps if for some reason the authorities show up. Your Exchange Partner can show them the letter and, if really neces. Permission letters are also helpful when you are exchanging your vehicles as part of the home exchange. If for some reason you are pulled over, it helps answer the questions, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½why are you driving so-and-soï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s car?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We had that happen to us in Arizona one time. We were pulled over for tinted windows. We gave the officers our letter with the vehicle registration and my driverï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s license. It made the discussion that much easier and pleasant. In the end, securing the things important to you and making a secure envi",

How is Planning for a home exchange different than Preparing for it?,"How is Planning for a home exchange different than Preparing for it? Planning is about coordinating the exchange. You have already agreed to exchange. You&rsquo;ve agreed to the parameters for the exchange. Now you want to coordinate with your Exchange Partner . There are logistics that go into the exchange. This is particularly true if you are arranging to exchange vehicles. The first thing that needs to be coordinated is vacating your home at the time your Exchange Partner is intending to arrive (and vice versa). Whether you are driving to the destination or flying, you need to ensure each of you are vacating your home prior to the time the other arrives. If you are exchanging your vehicles and you are arriving via an airport, you both may decide to send a key in advance so you each can drive to the home when you arrive. You may also want to coordinate your flights to arrive at the same airport the same day. We have done this where we sent our car and house key to our exchange partner and they did the same. We both coordinated our flights to arrive at the same airport (we had some options as to which airport so we coordinated the airport and date based on the most beneficial flight costs for us both). When we parked our car, we took a picture of the car, the nearest pole with the row posted on it so our Exchange Partner would be able to easily locate the car. We sent them a text with the picture and a brief description of where it was so they could tell the parking lot bus attendant where to take them. They did the same for us. It was so easy.",
Planning an exchange also takes into account special needs.,"Planning an exchange also takes into account special needs. Some of your Exchange Partners may need to arrange for special circumstances that you will want to accommodate. For instance, they may need special medicine and want to have the medicine delivered before they arrive. You may need to provide special storage (like storing it in a cool environment). They may have a special request where you will want to make sure it is available in your area. And, if not, you will want to make sure they are aware of it in advance. They may be wanting to order something in advance to have it shipped to your home prior to them arriving. This is particularly true when you are arranging an exchange with your Exchange Partner who is coming from outside the country. The lead time for something to be delivered may be longer than their stay and they may want to make sure it arrives either before they exchange or while they are exchanging. We had that happen with one of our Exchange Partners . They were a hobby enthusiast. The item they wanted was quite expensive in Europe. Being many times cheaper in the US, they asked us if they could order it in advance and have the item arrive prior to their visit. We said, &ldquo;Why not!&rdquo; They were very appreciative of our flexibility and we didn&rsquo;t mind at all. Whatever the case, planning is all about coordinating with your Exchange Partner based on the situation.",
`Planning also means making sure you know what you want to do during your Exchange.,"Planning also means making sure you know what you want to do during your Exchange . Where do you want to go? What attractions are you interested in. Will the Exchange serve as a base for local or regional travel? Essentially, you want to ask yourself what you want to accomplish while you are at your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home . For example, your whole motivation for exchanging may be to use your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home as a &ldquo;base&rdquo; from which to visit other places. This is especially true for longer exchanges or when you are traveling outside your home country. It is a good practice to share with your Exchange Partner what your motivation is to exchange. They may have particular experience that can be very useful to your stay. The kind of local experience that can prove quite valuable. They may know the best places to go, the best times to go, the best methods of travel to get there and perhaps, based on your interest, be able to recommend other things you had not considered. The more you share with your Exchange Partner what you are planning to do while you are visiting, the more they can help you in ways you haven&rsquo;t considered.",
Planning your stay has many obvious benefits.,"Planning your stay has many obvious benefits. It also can tell you something about your stay, by comparing what you had planned to do or hoped to do versus what you actually did. To that point, we had an Exchange Partner who planned to visit Montreal &amp; Quebec City during their four weeks stay at our Home . Our Home is near the Canadian border and a reasonable drive to Toronto or Montreal. When we talked to them the week we were coming home, we asked, &ldquo;How did you like Montreal and Quebec City?&rdquo; They laughed. They said they were having so much fun doing things in our city that they decided not to make the trip! Imagine that! In the end, they simply liked the things going on around our city and didn&rsquo;t feel a need to make the drive. Other Exchange Partners may want to use your home as a base to invite family. Do you mind? Maybe, maybe not. But, if you share your plans and they share theirs, you will be aware of their plans (and vice versa), be able to let them know your concerns, if any, and make both of you more comfortable about the plans you have. Planning is all about setting expectations and knowing what you want to accomplish while you are away. The main point is to take advantage of your stay.",
It is important to know what to bring during your home exchange.,"Planning is also important in helping you know what to bring during your home exchange. For example, are you planning to play golf or go fishing? Should you bring your equipment or rent? Does your Exchange Partner have equipment that they would be comfortable you using? Are you planning to shop and bring things home with you? Do you need another piece of luggage that will be empty on your way to the Home Exchange , but will be packed when you return home? Are you an adventure seeker and like to hike, kayak or raft? What equipment can you bring with you? What equipment will you need to rent or buy? Does your Exchange Partner know the best place to rent or buy those items? Are you wanting to shop for certain things that are not available or are much more expensive in your home location? How can your Exchange Partner help in determining where the best places are to visit or shop? These are all important questions to ask yourself as you plan your Home Exchange . The more you can anticipate your needs while you are at your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home , the more you can enjoy the exchange.",
Planning also involves taking care of your individual needs.,"Planning also involves taking care of your individual needs. Individual needs are the things you need due to your physical condition. Such things can include medicines, supplements, clothing, devices or other items that are specific to you and your physical needs. Individual needs can also include preferential items like linens, your favorite sleeping pillow or other comfort items. Whatever they are, you will want to consider what makes you comfortable. Take linens for example. We always provide two new sets of linens for our Home Exchange Partners . However, we have had some Exchange Partners bring their own linens because of allergic reactions to certain kinds of fabrics. They weren&rsquo;t sure we would have what they needed, so they brought their own. Once you have planned for your individual needs and if you are planning an extended Home Exchange (more than a week), you may want to discuss your requirements with your Exchange Partner to see if they mind you sending some of these items in advance of your exchange or if they already have items that precludes you from having to purchase, bring with you or ship ahead of time. Hey, in the end, whatever makes your Home Exchange comfortable, enjoyable and successful is what matter most!",
"During your stay, there are things you want to do immediately.","During your stay, there are things you want to do immediately. When you first arrive at your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home , you will want to familiarize yourself with your surroundings. You will want to familiarize yourself with; The Home itself ; where things are and how to use them. The Neighborhood ; who are your new neighbors &amp; where to shop for provisions. The Local Area ; where are the shopping centers, Rx centers, etc. The Extended Area ; where are the attractions, things you like to do and places you like to go. Also, there are things that you will want to do During your stay that includes the following. Communicate on a periodic basis with your Exchange Partner . Map Out &amp; Prioritize the things you want to accomplish while you are there. Develop a Things-to-Do List of activities that you want to accomplish during your Exchange . The &ldquo;To Do&rdquo; list always includes relaxing! We&rsquo;ll address these different items in more detail in future Stories .",
When you arrive familiarize yourself with the operational parts of the Home.,"When you first arrive at your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home , familiarize yourself with the operational parts of the Home . Your Exchange Partner should have their Home Exchange Binder laying in a prominent spot (like the kitchen counter or living room table) similarly to what you have done for them. It is also a courtesy if there is a little welcome note on top of the binder. If organized properly, the Home Exchange Binder should have &ldquo; How To &rdquo; sections on the operational items of the Home . Open the Home Exchange Binder and begin to familiarize yourself with it and the items within the Home . Operational items include how to operate the kitchen appliances, knowing how to use the garage door keypad (if there is one), where the circuit braker box is located &amp; how it is labeled, how to operate the HVAC controls and the entertainment center. Start with the most important items and go from there. Generally, the most important items are the circuit breaker (assuming you&rsquo;ve arrived during the daytime), the HVAC controls and, in today&rsquo;s world, the WiFi web key so you have Internet access to your phones, tablets and PC&rsquo;s. Obviously, next on the short list are the kitchen appliances and the area lighting. Don&rsquo;t take knowing the area lighting for granted. When it is dark, you will want to know how to turn lights on and off, where they are, particularly if you have steps or stairs to negotiate. Further down the list are things like where the water shutoffs are located, how to operate the garage, are there awning structures or deck umbrellas to operate or how to operate the barbeque grill (if there is one). If there is a pool or spa, how to do you operate those. What are the safety requirements, precautions? In the end, the sooner you familiarize yourself with your Exchange Home , the sooner you will feel comfortable and can begin to settle in like it is Your Home . After all, it is Your Home for the duration of your stay.",
Get to know the Neighborhood.,"Getting to know the Neighborhood is the next step after you&rsquo;ve familiarize yourself with your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home . And, of course, getting to know your new Neighbors is paramount. These are the people who are looking out for the Homeowner . And, they are looking out for you. That has always been my experience. And, the same thing is happening back at your Home , too. They will want to get to know who you are, where you come from (in more detail than your Exchange Partner shared with them). Neighbors will want to know your interests and your background. They will want to know your career experience and your retirement experience (if you are retired). In short, your new Neighbors will want to learn about you. And, they will want to share things about themselves, too. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be having a glass of wine or a cold beer on the back deck, patio or porch making new friends! As for getting to know the Neighborhood , you will want to know where the vital places are to get all the things you will need. These include the everyday places like gas stations, grocery stores, convenience stores, hardware stores and the like. You will also want to know which gas station has the best prices and which grocery stores have the best prices, produce, fresh food, organics, etc. This is where your new found Neighbors can be very helpful. You will also want to know where Neighborhood facilities are located, when they are open and when they close. Examples include community pools, golf courses, tennis courts, workout facilities and such. In the end, the sooner you familiarize yourself with your new Neighborhood , the more comfortable you will be in your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home .",
Knowing the Local Area is about exploring.,"Knowing the Local Area is about exploring, creating experiences and maintaining safety. Familiarizing yourself with the Local Area surrounding your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home is important. Knowing routes to and from the Home is important. Roads can be blocked and there can be detours due to construction, accidents or other reasons. Knowing alternative routes back to your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s Home will be helpful, if not expedient. Knowing what a locality has to offer (attractions, entertainment, special interests or places unique to your Exchange Home ) can prove useful in charting your activities during your Exchange . Such local knowledge can enhance your experience during your stay. And, there is the ever-important issue of safety. It&rsquo;s a sad reality but not every Neighborhood is necessarily safe for outsiders. Knowing areas of a locality to shy away from can be very important, particularly when relying on GPS systems. Sometimes the most direct route is not the best route to take. Deciding to eat at a dining establishment, while highly recommended, that is in a difficult neighborhood may be cause for reconsideration. Knowing the Local Area well enough can enhance your Exchange experience and keep you out of potentially difficult situations.",
Every Home Exchange you visit has an Extended Area worthy of exploring.,"Every Home Exchange you visit has an Extended Area worthy of exploring. Extended Areas can mean many different things depending on the duration associated with your Exchange . If you are only staying for a long weekend or a week, your ability to explore Extended Areas will be somewhat limited. At best, you will only have opportunities to visit extremely unique offerings of that local area. For example, if you are Exchanging with someone from Toronto, Canada and you have not visited Niagara Falls, you might take the time to drive or take the train to Niagara Falls, Canada for the day, even if your Exchange is relatively short. In most cases, for shorter duration Exchanges , you will be looking closer to your Exchange Home . If, on the other hand, you are staying for a couple of weeks or more, planning an overnight stay somewhere during your stay may make for a nice diversion. An example would be Exchanging with someone in Phoenix, AZ. If you have never visited the Grand Canyon and you are as close as Phoenix (a four-hour drive, give or take) you wouldn&rsquo;t want to pass it up. Whatever your situation, you will always want to look at the Extended Area for opportunities to enhance your Home Exchange experience.",
Extended Areas can mean many different things.,"As mentioned in the previous Story , every Home Exchange you visit has an Extended Area worthy of exploring. Extended Areas can mean many different things depending on the locality of your Home Exchange . If you are visiting a densely populated locality like Baltimore, MD, your ability to explore Extended Areas can extend to other metropolitan areas like Washington DC, Philadelphia and even New York City. Taking advantage of visiting these localities depends on whether you plan to drive or take a train to these areas and, of course, the time you are spending at your Exchange Home . If you are in the western US, there are greater distances between cities. So are other destinations like National Parks. Still, considering visiting such destinations can enhance your Exchange visit. Again, your length of stay and mode of transportation will greatly determine your ability to explore the Extended Areas . Whatever your interest and the locality you are visiting, consider learning more about the Extended Area . If you include them in your plans, your Exchange can be even more rewarding.",
It is important you Communicate with your Exchange Partners during your Exchange.,"It is important you Communicate with your Exchange Partners during your Exchange . Whether you choose to keep in contact via text, a phone call or Skype/Zoom calls depends on several factors. Why and under what circumstances do you need to communicate? If you are just letting them know you&rsquo;ve arrived and all is well, a text message will suffice. If you are wanting to touch base on an issue that has come up or you are uncertain on how to operate something (that is not included in the Home Exchange Binder ) you may want to text or email to schedule a call, whether by phone, Skype or Zoom. If it is an emergency, you will certainly want to call as soon as possible. If you are unable to connect, you may want to send a text asking your Exchange Partner to return your call at their earliest convenience. Depending upon the emergency, you may want to give them an idea of the issue in the text. If your Exchange is more than a week, you should consider a regularly scheduled meeting each week. Of course, flexibility is important when it comes to adjusting scheduled calls to accommodate both Exchange Partners . Communicate with your Exchange Partner . It will bring comfort and peace during your Exchange stay.",
Map Out & Prioritize your stay. It helps you take full advantage of your Exchange.,"Early in your Home Exchange , Map Out &amp; Prioritize your stay. It helps you take full advantage of your Exchange . You spent time before you arrived at your Exchange Home deciding what you wanted to accomplish during your Exchange . Shortly after you arrive, it is a good idea to review your plans. When you talk with your new Neighbors , they may make you aware of other attractions, places of interest you hadn&rsquo;t considered or activities you didn&rsquo;t know about before you arrived. Armed with newer, more complete information, compare your plans. You can make adjustments and changes to your plans.

Why do I recommend you review your original plans and finalize your Things-to-Do List ? Because you now have all the information necessary to take full advantage of your Home Exchange . We learned the value of creating a Things-to-Do List from one of our Exchange Partners . They were from the west coast of the US and had never visited Montreal or Quebec City. Those cities are four and six hours, respectively, away from our Home . We were Exchanging our Homes for a month. They planned to drive to those cities and stay a few days. As it turned out, they found many more things to do nearer to our Home and cancelled their side trip to Montreal &amp; Quebec City. When we asked why they didn&rsquo;t make the trek, they said they were having so much fun around our Home locality that they didn&rsquo;t feel the need to make the trip. The moral of the Story ? It&rsquo;s important to have a Plan for your Exchange . AND, it&rsquo;s important to review the Plan During your visit to fully enjoy your Exchange experience.

During the contact, you should reiterate your openness to be contacted in the future especially if your Exchange Partner finds something wrong with the Home since your stay. Remaining open and being available is another courtesy you can afford your Exchange Partner . We have remained in contact with many of our Exchange Partners over the years as we follow the path of their lives, and they follow ours.",
Resolving Issues After an Exchange,"Once both Exchange Partners have arrived home, there may be issues that need to be resolved. These can fall into several categories. Simple Questions &ndash; These do not impact either partner. Minor or Major Issues &ndash; These directly involve the Exchange Partners. If your Exchange Partner has a simple question, obviously you want to provide any information you can for them. If it is a matter of a minor or major issue, it is best to make yourself available in a direct way via phone conversation or video conference to discuss the issue in detail. Having that personal contact can me instrumental to clear communication and help avoid misunderstandings. Both Exchange Partners should be open to resolving the issue in the most equitable way possible given the circumstance. There are two things at work here. We should always want to practice the &ldquo;Golden Rule&rdquo;, asking how we would want the situation resolved if the roles were reversed. You and your Exchange Partner can (and should) Rate each other After the Exchange . Any unsatisfactorily resolved issues can be raise in the review. Again, clarity and objectiveness should dictate your review of the situation. In general, you should always report to your Exchange Partner any issues that arise During your Exchange and resolve them at that time. It will leave you both with the best possible Exchange experience.",
Rating your Exchange Partner & your Exchange experience.,"After you have returned from your Exchange Partner&rsquo;s home, you should make sure there are no unresolved issues between you. It is best to have one last communication between both Exchange Partners to bring closure to your Exchange experience. At that point, you are in a position to Rate your Exchange Partner . You Rate your Exchange Partner by going to Seniorhomexchange.com , logging in and going to the Public Page of your Exchange Partner . You can Rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 for the following elements. Accuracy Location Communication Flexibility Cleanliness Value You can add a comment to add detail to the ratings you give your Exchange Partner .

How Important are Property Attributes?,"Property attributes matter, but not for the reason you may think. Accurately depicting your property is very important for you and the satisfaction of your exchange partner. What is interesting though, for most members, the equality of an exchange (in terms of the property) is less important than other factors. We&rsquo;ve exchange with other members where their home was much nicer than ours. And, we&rsquo;ve had other exchanges where the reverse was true. Why is the disparity of a property not so important in an exchange? Because an exchange is temporary in nature and, therefore, other factors are more important, like locality or circumstance. For example, if you are exchanging because you are visiting family, your most important factor is going to a place that is near them. Or you may be going to an out-of-town wedding. In either case, the location matters far more than whether the home you are staying at is exactly as nice as your home. Having said that, Property Attributes are important to let other members know what to expect if they exchange with you.",
Why use Property Attributes?,"Property Attributes allow other members know details about your property. Property Attributes include the following. Home Type Number of Floors Number of Bedrooms Number of Bathrooms Transportation issues Entertainment Living Amenities Miscellaneous Special Considerations Making selections as they apply to your home and your situation is very helpful to other members searching for potential exchange partners. For example, if another member has physical restrictions, exchanging with a member who has a multi-floor dwelling may not be suitable for them. That member may want to limit their searches to members who have a single floor home arrangement (or a condo with elevator access). The more details you can provide about your home, the greater the potential for finding members who can or will want to exchange with you.",
Why provide details about your property?,"Details about your property can be broken into several categories. Details about your home. Details related to transportation. Home amenities. Special Considerations We have created these categories to help you inform other members about your property. Each of these categories helps you determine your interest in another member&rsquo;s property. And, they help another member determine their interest in your property. Home exchanging involves finding the &ldquo;right&rdquo; situations. That includes timing (when to go and for how long), where to go and does a property suit your situation. It is this latter point that we are focused on here.",
Why specifics about your home are important?,"Details about your home relate to the physical living space. This matters for members who may have limitations or specific needs. For example, if a potential exchange partner has some physical limitation that precludes them from walking up and down steps, they will want to look for other member properties that are on a single floor (either a single floor home or a condo with elevator access). These categories are physical in nature. Home Type Number of Floors Number of Bedrooms Number of Bathrooms Number of bedrooms may be important if your exchange partner is wanting to invite family members to visit them during their exchange. That has happened in our case and, of course, you will want to declare your intention and clear it with your exchange partner to make sure they are ok with it.",
People have exchanged their automobiles!,"Why are details pertaining to transportation important? It matters to your exchange partner. Here are the elements you can select. Free Parking Is there are garage? Is a golf cart available? Are you open to a vehicle exchange. Imagine, going someplace for a month, exchanging your home and your automobile. Now that is a low-cost getaway! No rental car or hotel cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you have to be comfortable with your exchange partner, but it is something we&rsquo;ve done. It was fantastic! People also want to know what issue they have with parking while at their exchange partner&#39;s place. Is there designated parking (like in a condo complex)? Does your vehicle need to be registered in order to get into a gated community? These are the kind of considerations you and your exchange partner need to be aware of.",
