There are two Paid Plan options; Six-Month (180-days) plan &amp; Annual (one-year) plan.

Other members with a current subscription can see your Public Profile via Explore . If they send you a message via Messages , you will receive an email saying you have a message from another member."
How Do I Search Other Members to Arrange an Exchange?,"There are two ways to engage other Members in order to find potential exchange partners.&nbsp; Explore Places-to-Go is the main search engine. You initiate the search based on a set of criteria. You can perform basic searches or create an advanced search by selecting specific attributes. Time-to-Go is a great feature that uses our proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) ! You enter a future date range (the beginning date and the end date) of the time you would like to exchange and you select the property you want to exchange. For most, that will be your only property listed. SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM AI then matches all other Member&rsquo;s date ranges with your date range. Members are listed (in the order of best matches) under your date range. You can have up to four Time-to-Go date ranges! From Time-to-Go , you can Message one or send one message to several matching members to determine the interest in a future exchange. When a date range has passed, SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM automatically removes the expired date range from your Time-to-Go date ranges. You can add another date range and we then match other Members with the new date range."
How to Performing a Search in Explore?,"You search other Member properties via Explore . You can perform a general search or you can perform an advanced search based on a number of criteria (attributes). A general search includes metropolitan area, region or state (for the US), province (for Canada) or country. Advanced searches allow you to include or exclude potential Members based on certain attributes; Member Affiliatoins and Special Considerations . You would select one or more Member Affilitations to narrow the list of members in your Explore search. Member Affiliations are Educators , Law Enforcement and Military . If you have an affiliation with any of these, you will want to click all that apply in your My Profile page. That way, likeminded people who have had a similar affilation or career can find you. Similarly, Special Considerations are targeted around those who allow pets and those who allow smoking in their home. Again, if you have a strong preference that revolves around either of these Special Considerations , you will want to make sure you click those attributes on your My Profile page. Members prefer to exchange with other members who are likeminded in terms of career, pet ownership and smoking (or non-smoking). The more information you can provide other members through your My Profile and Property Profile , the better your chance of success in finding compatible exchange partners. It is very important to complete your profile as much as possible (including Personal Profile , Property Profile , Exchange Preferences and Member Affiliation attributes) to make it easy for other Members to locate you."
How Does Time-to-Go Match Members?,"SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM uses Artificial Inetelligence ( AI ) technology to search and update all Members&nbsp; Time-to-Go date ranges. It matches other members date ranges compatible to your date ranges and orders them according to best match. For example, it is February and you know you would like to exchange the second week of August of the same year. You enter the beginning date range, the ending date range for that week and assign your property. SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM AI technology searches all other Members&rsquo; date ranges for matches to your date range (the second week of August, in this example). All Member date ranges that most closely match your date range are given a percentage match. A match score of 100% means your date range and the date range of that Member are identical. Member Time-to-Go &nbsp;matches are listed in descending order (highest percentage match to lowest). Each Member has the opportunity to create up to four separate Time-to-Go date ranges. Then you sit back and let SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM AI tecnology find you other members with similar&nbsp; Time-to-Go date ranges. If you have a current Free Trial or Paying Membership , you can view the other Member&rsquo;s property and public profile and communicate with them via Messages ."
How Do I Contact Other Members to Arrange an Exchange?,"When you want to contact a Member (or group of Members ) through the Explore PLACES TO GO search or a TIME TO GO date range, you can send those Members an InMail Message . When you click on the Public Profile Image of a Member , you will go to their Public Profile page. On the Public Profile page you can click on the Send In-Mail Message button. When you want to send a group message to multiple Members from either the Explore PLACES TO GO or TIME TO GO , you select any number (or all) of the Members from your search result by clicking on the box in the lefthand corner of the Property image. Once selected, you can click on the Send In Mail button to create a group message. A group message window opens. Enter your Subject , Message &amp; click the Send button. Your message will be sent to all the Members you selected. Your InMail Message includes your Property Image . Everyone receiving your InMail Message can click on your Property Image to view your Public Profile . Your In-Mail Messages are in the My Account section. Click the Messages button on the lefthand side to see your In-Mail Messages with other members. Note, any messages that you send to a group of members will not appear in your Messages unless (or until) a member responds to your message. Free Trial and Paying Members will be able to respond right away. I f your membership has expired, you will be prompted to renew to a Six-Month or Annual plan when you log in before you can access to the member portal."
What are the Lengths of Exchanges?,The length of exchange is determined by the Members who agree to exchange their properties. The website encourages you to exchange as many times as you like. There is no limit! You can choose any combination of Exchange Preference durations; Long Weekends One Week Several Weeks Month or More Members set their preferences in My Account on the My Profile page. You select as many Exchange Preference durations that apply to you.
How Do I Arrange an Exchange?,"Once you have received a message from another Member who is interested in an exchange through Messages , we recommend you send at least two or three additional InMail Messages specifically to that Member discussing the time (month, season, year, etc.) and duration of your exchange. Once you have established a good dialog, you will want to communicate directly via your personal email, Facebook account, phone, FaceTime, Skype, Teams, What&#39;s App &amp;/or Zoom to continue the dialog. Remember, SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is an exchange forum. We promote exchanges between members, but it is ultimately your responsibiity to vet your exchange partner. That is why we recommend multiple conversations in multiple ways to get to know each other."
Do Members Exchange Their Vehicles as Part of an Exchange?,"Some Members do, others don&rsquo;t. It is an individual choice and depends on the circumstances of the two exchanging Members. It can be a highly beneficial option and certainly a cost saving benefit for both exchange Members. Ultimately, it is at the sole discretion and agreement between the exchanging Members."
What Must You Do to Prepare Your Home?,"In general, prepare your Home in the way you would want it prepared for you. You want your Exchange Partners to feel at home, comfortably living there for the term of exchange. You want to provide them with the necessary room (closet space, drawer space &amp; information for Internet, TV, etc.) in order to enjoy the amenities they enjoy when in their own Home . You will want to have an Exchange Binder informing your Exchange Partner on how to use the entertainment center (TV, Cable, DVD, Stereo, etc.), how to log into your Guest WiFi for Internet access and many other things about your Home while staying there. As a minimum, you should do a little &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; cleaning and organize things that should be organized. To learn more, go to the Stories page, click on the Serch a Topic link and scroll down to Preparing to read up on Bob&#39;s Blog pertaining to the topic."
How Do I Vet Potential Exchange Partners?,"Vetting a potential exchange partner is the sole responsibility of each Member. In general, you should have a number of written correspondence, several phone conversations and a few face-to-face conversations via digital app with your potential exchange partners. Common sense applies here. You will want to know things about the Members you are exchanging with and you will want your potential exchange partners to know similar things about you as well. If for some reason you are uncomfortable with the Member in the vetting process, there is not obligation on your part to go through with the exchange. You are free to call it off at any time. There is no penalty for aborting a previously arranged exchange. Members who have agreed to an exchange are absolutely encouraged to Review each other. Under normal circumstances this is done after an exchange has occurred or after a potential exchange has been aborted. The rating feedback is helpful for all Members to assess future exchanges with other Members. By sharing your experience about an exchange and your experience with your exchange partner, you help our exchange community. To learn more, go to the Bob&#39;s Blog page, click on the Serch a Topic link and scroll down to Vetting to read up on Bob&#39;s Blog pertaining to the topic."
How Do We Review Our Exchange Partners?,"Members who have completed an exchange are encouraged to review one another. Member reviews are an important way we, as a community, inform each other of our experiences. Of course, reviews should be done in fairness and commensurate with your exchange experience. In general, only Members who have completed an exchange should be reviewing each other. Once an exchange has been completed (or a previously arranged exchange has been aborted), both Members are encouraged to Review their exchange partner. To review the Member, Go to the Member&#39;s Public Profile page. You can get there by going to the Explore Places to Go page, select the Country, State/Province, City search and click on their property or you can select the Property image from your InMail Messages communication. On the Member&#39;s Public Profile page click on the Review This Member button. A Review This Member pop-up window will appear. Select the appropriate number of stars for each category, make any comments you think will be helpful and click the Submit button. If you have reviewed your exchange partner, but they have not reviewed you, your review will appear in their My Account/Reviews section under Review Received . They will not be able to see your review of them until they have reviewed you. In general, reviews are published only when both exchange partners have reviewed each other. If a Member has reviewed you, but you have not exchanged with them, you have the option to delete their review. In such cases, the review is not published and does not affect your review scores. There may be exceptions where&nbsp; SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM (at its sole discretion) may publish a Member&rsquo;s rating of another Member if the other Member has not responded in a reasonable time period or for other reasons (including but not limited to a violation of&nbsp; the website Terms of Use policy)."

Your Public Profile is what other Members see when they search for you either through Explore &nbsp;or via Time-to-Go &nbsp;date range matches. However, when you search via&nbsp; Explore &nbsp;you will not see your Public Profile . The website knows you are logged in and assumes you are looking for other Member Profiles to exchange with, not yours. When non-Members visits the website, they can see a few Member properties on the Explore &nbsp;page. However, if they click on a specific Member Property, they are directed to the Log In page rather than the Member&#39;s Public Profile . If they are not currently a Member, they can Click on the Join link or Join icon to become a Member. To state it another way, no member Public Profile is avilable on the public side of the website. Only members logged into the Member portal have access to and can see other member&#39;s Public Profile ."
What Fields Must I Populate to Complete My Account Setup?,"SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is designed to maximize your abilty to attract potential Exchange Partners . And, we have done so without exposing your personal information! That is why we provide you (though our Messages section) an ability to communicate with other Members (individually or in groups) via InMail . Only when you have fully vetted a Member on a potential exchange do you want to take your communications outside SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM .

Note, your image will not be shown until you click the Update button. 10% is added by clicking on at least one Exchange Preferences Check Box on the My Profile page. Exchange Preferences indicate the types of exchange timeframe you are willing to make. The more exchange timeframes you select obviously improves your chances of finding exchange partners. Remember, the more other Members know about you, the more likely you will find others to exchange with. &nbsp;"
What Is Involved in Populating My Exchange Preferences?,"SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is designed to maximize your abilty to attract potential Exchange Partners . And, we have done so without exposing your personal information! That is why we provide you (though our Messages section) an ability to communicate with other Members (individually or in groups). Only when you have fully vetted a Member on a potential exchange do you want to take your communications outside SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM .

Member Preferences - Personal attributes that help Members know something about you. Exchange Preferences - This is one of the most important fields to populate because it shows what timeframes you are interested or willing to exchange. Obviously, the more information you make available to prospective exchange partners the better your chance of finding exchanges."
"If I Own Two Properties, Can I List Only My Vacation Home?","In short, YES! SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM allows you to list two properties at no additional charge. However, if you have a vacation property and you only want to list it, why not? We do not require you to list your home property. We only require that one property be listed. You decide which home you want to list if you have that choice. In fact, some of our Members chose to use their vacation home as leverage to travel elsewhere rather than feeling the need to always go to that home. It is a perfect way to see new places and enjoy new experiences."
Is SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM only for Seniors?,"Not exactly. We chose SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM for our website because we belonged to a website by that name years ago. It was available, we liked the name and we went with it! SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM is ideally designed for people fifty and over. Generally, we are empty nesters, have flexibility and want to travel; whether to visit our kids, other family members, friends or just want to go places now that we can. Our Members like to maximize their travel budget and recognize staying in someone elses home is an experience that has come of age. Of course, anyone can Join SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM and if they do, we assume they value using their home as a means to travel. As you interact with other Members , you will get to know them. In the end, your decision to exchange with another Member is between the two of you. Once you get to know each other (regardless of age or any other factor) you&#39;ll know if they are people you would like to exchange with. Our commitment is building a community of like-minded people who share the same sense of adventure, desire to travel and want to live it out."
What is the Best Way to Use Time-to-Go?,"Using our proprietary Artificial Intelligence technology, Time-to-Go is designed to make it easier for Members to connect with one another. AND , the best way to do that is to connect Members based on when you are available to travel &amp;/or when you want to travel. There are two main ways to utilize Time-to-Go . Ridged Dates - Create a date range based on dates you are available to travel. For example, not everyone is retired that belongs to the SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM community. Some Members have certain dates for vacation or other fixed times off from their place of work. Their time off begins on a certain date and they have to be back at work on a certain date. These are Ridged Dates where you would like to arrange an exchange. Flexible Dates - Create a broad date range based on a range of dates you are open to travel. Some Members are seasonal workers or, if retired, only want to travel during certain seasons. In these cases, you will want to put an extended date range. For example, teachers generally have the summer off between the end of June and the end of August. Such Members will want to put a date range from the end of June to the end of August. Then, as SENIORHOMEXCHANGE.COM AI captures other Member&#39;s date ranges within your broad date range, you can send them InMail Messages to begin a dialog, find out which dates are acceptible to them and determine if you can be flexible, accepting the other Member&#39;s date range. Time-to-Go &nbsp;is a service&nbsp;making&nbsp;it easier for you to connect and arrange exchanges with other Members !"
